subtext: |
  Within pkg/stanza, there is a log entry converter that starts off with a worker count equal to the 
  CPU count divided by 4. Having a number of workers tied to the number of operating system threads, 
  that can execute user-level Go code simultaneously (Configured using GOMAXPROCS), is more reasonable.
  The fix will factor in GOMAXPROCS inplace of the CPU count. An unset GOMAXPROCS will result in the
  old behavior, thus having no effect on other users.
